\section{Name and Domain}
The website URL is \textit{https://www.brugnolaro.com/it/}.\\
The domain's name is \textit{"brugnolaro"} and it sounds good: it has been
shortened because the full name should be \textit{Brugnolaro Calzature
Store}. Length it is neither long nor short, so it could be easy to memorize.
If the full name had been used as domain's name, people would probably need
more effort in order to remember it.\\
The \textit{.com} domain is used and this is a good point because people are
used with it.
