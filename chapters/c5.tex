\section{Final evaluation}
The website is a standard website which follows the main nowadays tendencies.
For that reason it sometimes sacrifices usability for having a nice look.
There are also some choices which are not explicable, so there would be some work to do.
Anyway it implements some solutions to solve both persistent and non-persistent usability
problems.
The final grade should be around 6.5.
