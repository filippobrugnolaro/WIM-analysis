\section{Home Page}
The home page is how the website appear to users, so it has to give a clear
idea about the content of internal pages. Moreover, it has to provide all
the necessary information to the user in a fast and clear way.
The best way to analyze it is answering to what in journalism is called
the 6 \textit{W}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Where?
    \item Who?
    \item Why?
    \item What?
    \item When?
    \item How?
\end{itemize}

Before analyzing it, we define how the home page's structure is composed.
